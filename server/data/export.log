  'These include, controlling the kinds of computing resources you use, and choosing how electricity is generated to power these resources.',
  'We also cover options for running infrastructure on renewable power, and what options you have when you don’t have direct control over where power comes from.',
  'We also end up emitting CO2 when we burn fossil fuels to move actual physical things around, like people, parcels, and so on, in jets and cars for business travel, and so on.',
  'We also emit CO2 when we burn fossil fuels to keep places we work well-lit and depending where you are in the world warm or cool enough to work in.',
  'In short, CO2 emissions occur whenever we generate electricity, and we haven’t used renewable energy to do so.',
  'And right now, about majority of the energy used to power the the servers that run the web comes on fossil fuels.',
  'Historically the most common fossil fuel we’ve used has also been coal, which about the worst fuel we could be burning, environmentally speaking.',
  'It’s been chosen before largely because it’s cheap, and within relatively easy access, but it kills more people per kilowatt hour than any other commonly used fuel.',
  'It also emits more radioactive matter than any other fuel (including nuclear), and in most cases, emits the most carbon dioxide per unit of electricity.',
  'Generally speaking, if we want to generate electricity without emitting CO2 in the process, renewables are the way to go.',
  'This means more waiting for the image to arrive, more infrastructure to power, and therefore more CO2 emitted.',
  'While we might not be able to stop using the web, we can change how we build and power it, to make it planet friendly as well as user friendly.',
  'All the content in the Planet Friendly Web Guide is available under the Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 license, and the source code for this site, and all the text is freely avaiable on Github.',
  'So a relatively fast 4G connection typically uses more energy to download the same amount of data as a 3G.',
  'Unsurprisingly, it takes network infrastructure to move data from the servers you run, to a user’s device.',
  'So, transmitting the same video file over a wired connection uses a different amount to sending it wirelessly.',
  'On top of that, different speeds of wireless connection also use different amounts of power.',
  'With a forthcoming move to 5G, connections are likely to use more power still.',
  'Even before we take into account their typically reduced range, meaning we’ll need more of base stations running to cover the same area.',
  'You typically do this directly, by having your own server in a rack you rent in a datacenter, or indirectly, paying per compute-unit with cloud computing, or a software as a service offering.',
  'In addition to taking infrastructure to move data from your servers to your users, you need power to run your own servers.',
  'It is also the biggest machine on earth, and it runs mostly on coal, which is bad news for our climate.' ]
