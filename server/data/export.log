  - Filtered 30 sentences [ 'Choices you make about your product’s technical architecture also affect how easily and quickly you can adjust the amount of resources you use directly.',
  'These include, controlling the kinds of computing resources you use, and choosing how electricity is generated to power these resources.',
  'We also cover options for running infrastructure on renewable power, and what options you have when you don’t have direct control over where power comes from.',
  'We also end up emitting CO2 when we burn fossil fuels to move actual physical things around, like people, parcels, and so on, in jets and cars for business travel, and so on.',
  'We also emit CO2 when we burn fossil fuels to keep places we work well-lit and depending where you are in the world warm or cool enough to work in.',
  'In short, CO2 emissions occur whenever we generate electricity, and we haven’t used renewable energy to do so.',
  'And right now, about majority of the energy used to power the the servers that run the web comes on fossil fuels.',
  'Historically the most common fossil fuel we’ve used has also been coal, which about the worst fuel we could be burning, environmentally speaking.',
  'It’s been chosen before largely because it’s cheap, and within relatively easy access, but it kills more people per kilowatt hour than any other commonly used fuel.',
  'It also emits more radioactive matter than any other fuel (including nuclear), and in most cases, emits the most carbon dioxide per unit of electricity.',
  'This is where the internet can claim a success story: the internet giants like Amazon, Google, and Apple have been a significant driver in renewable purchases globally, in recent years.',
  'In the summer of 2017 Apple’s 1.5 US dollar billion green bond made history as the largest ever bond issued by a corporation.',
  'Generally speaking, if we want to generate electricity without emitting CO2 in the process, renewables are the way to go.',
  'in 2016, Google became the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewables, as it continued its run of investment in power for its datacentres.',
  'The mix of energy that goes into generating electricity differs wildly depending on where you are in the world - this is sometimes down to geography, and sometimes it’s down to policy decisions made by a region’s government.',
  'If we’re in London, and trying to download a cat picture from a website, based in Australia, fetching the data results in a lot of hops along a lot of networks.',
  'When we look at this map, it gives us an idea of how clean the emissions are likely to be, on average for a country - for example we can see that in France, with its heavy reliance on nuclear energy, generating a kilowatt hour of electricity than Poland, which is heavily invested in coal.',
  'This means more waiting for the image to arrive, more infrastructure to power, and therefore more CO2 emitted.',
  'While we might not be able to stop using the web, we can change how we build and power it, to make it planet friendly as well as user friendly.',
  'All the content in the Planet Friendly Web Guide is available under the Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 license, and the source code for this site, and all the text is freely avaiable on Github.',
  'So a relatively fast 4G connection typically uses more energy to download the same amount of data as a 3G.',
  'Unsurprisingly, it takes network infrastructure to move data from the servers you run, to a user’s device.',
  'So, transmitting the same video file over a wired connection uses a different amount to sending it wirelessly.',
  'On top of that, different speeds of wireless connection also use different amounts of power.',
  'With a forthcoming move to 5G, connections are likely to use more power still.',
  'Even before we take into account their typically reduced range, meaning we’ll need more of base stations running to cover the same area.',
  'You typically do this directly, by having your own server in a rack you rent in a datacenter, or indirectly, paying per compute-unit with cloud computing, or a software as a service offering.',
  'In addition to taking infrastructure to move data from your servers to your users, you need power to run your own servers.',
  'It is also the biggest machine on earth, and it runs mostly on coal, which is bad news for our climate.',
